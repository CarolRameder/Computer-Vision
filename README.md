# Computer-Vision

Working with Pytorch models in Lab_project_part2.ipynb
Updated the final project notebook after detecting an error in model architecture. Increased the accuracy up to 26.5% compared to the initial version of the project, which was documented in the report.

4 team assignments: Notebook files with task description implementation and results in the same file

1 individual final project with the task description, final report and implementation each in a separate file
